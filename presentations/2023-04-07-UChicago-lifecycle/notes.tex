\section{Questions in Chronological Order}



\textbf{JH}:\emph{Slide 5} What are beliefs about praise/stigma?

\emph{
    Maybe we should have gone straight to praise/stigma - since he got so held up on 
    this?
}
\newline
\newline

\textbf{JH}: This is a community condition - you're not necessarily stigmatising 
yourself, but rather saying your community is dirty.

\emph{\textbf{AK}: I'm going to show data on individual level views about deworming}
\newline 
\newline

\textbf{Jin:}\emph{Slide 6} How we know unique equilibrium? Each community has 
its own idiosyncratic equilibrium takeup.

\emph{
Point one, super minor quibble, I think we veered towards making the same mistake Anna Vitali did here. We said something 
like: We're going to use our structural estimation technique and make sure things aren't too 
in the tails.
I think it'd be better if we make it clear the unique equilibrium comes from theory.
Theory gives unique equilibrium $\rightarrow$ our model is identified $\rightarrow$ we estimate parameters.
We don't want to confuse identification and estimation. In reality, they just bound 
$1 + \mu \Delta'$ in the Laws and Norms paper, so what you said is basically true but 
the identification police might get angry.
Point two, \textbf{AK:} this is exactly why we need to introduce exogenous shocks to takeup 
so that we're not doing inference with endogenous takeup equilibrium.
}
\newline

\textbf{MK}: \emph{Slide $\approx$ 9} Do you have data on who's showing up? Are we getting 
infected/non-infected people? Do we know where people are coming from/what are their occupations?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Q}: \emph{Map slide/close-far} Are we putting PoTs in an urban area, individuals living 
in rural areas travel to the urban town to get dewormed and also do shopping - individuals are 
just signalling their wealth/ability to shop?
\emph{
    \textbf{AK}: No, we're chosing where the PoTs are. They're like grains of sand on the beach, etc.
}
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Q}: Since worms are endemic, are there communities where rep returns are higher/lower 
and exploit that exposure.
\newline
\newline
\textbf{JH}: How often do you have to deworm? How do people get infected? 
\emph{
    \textbf{AK}: 6 months/if you want to eradicate worms, everyone just needs to take it intensively and 
    we'd eradicate them. Random discussion across the room here.
}
\newline
\newline
\textbf{Q (Jin?)}: Why not just give to kids using current programmes and have them 
pass on to parents?
\newline
\newline
\textbf{JH}: How much does $v^*$ depend on previous deworming behaviour?
